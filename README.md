# Smart_Classroom_Using_Arduino

Smart Classroom – Arduino UNO Project

This project automates basic classroom functions using Arduino UNO.
It monitors temperature, humidity, motion, and people count, and controls the fan, lights, and status LEDs accordingly.
The system displays live room data on an I2C LCD and reacts instantly without delay-based blocking.

Main Features,
Temperature & humidity display on LCD
Fan control based on temperature threshold
People counting using dual IR sensors
Automatic light control based on room occupancy
Motion-activated LED pattern (Yellow → Red → Green × 5)
Non-blocking logic using millis()
Boot-up screen: “Welcome to Smart Classroom”

Behavior,
If the room has people → Light ON
If temperature crosses threshold → Fan ON
Motion detected → LED sequence runs 5 times
